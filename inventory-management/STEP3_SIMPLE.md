## Still Confused?
Think of it like this:
- **Step 1-2:** Put your app on GitHub (like uploading to Google Drive)
- **Step 3:** Tell Vercel "take my app from GitHub and make it a website"
- **Vercel does all the hard work automatically**
- **You get a working website URL**

It's like hiring someone to build your website for you - you just tell them where to find your code (GitHub) and they handle everything else!
